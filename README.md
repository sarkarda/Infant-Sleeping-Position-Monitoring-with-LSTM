# Infant-Sleeping-Position-Monitoring-with-LSTM
This project aims to enhance infant safety by monitoring their sleeping positions using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. By analyzing various parameters such as leg movement, tag visibility, and time, we predict safe sleeping positions and contribute to preventing SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome).
